# Course Mapper
## Introduction
This project was developed within a 24-hour timeframe for the Artificial Intelligence Hackathon organized by the Innovate Club at Northeastern University, Boston. Our goal was to address a common challenge faced by students: planning their degree to ensure they meet all course and credit requirements and graduate on schedule.

## Project Walkthrough
We can broadly divide the application into three different steps: web scraping all the necessary information from the university's curriculum website, ranking courses based on availability, credits, and required prerequisites, and finally matching them with the student's interests after graduation. We also built a natural language processing extraction script that identifies the most sought-after skills for every job role. You can find both the course ranking and skill matching scripts in this repository. Please check out the latest version if you find multiple files.

## Finalists!
This project helped us advance to the final round of the hackathon, out of a total of twenty-eight teams.
